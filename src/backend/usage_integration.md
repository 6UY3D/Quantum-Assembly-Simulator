1. Include these new backend modules in your build system (Makefile, CMake, etc.). For example:
   ```bash
   gcc -O3 -msse4.2 -pthread -I../core -I../assembly -I. \
    circuit_optimizer.c parallel_execution.c memory_management.c \
    -c
   ```
2. Link them with your core (qubit.c, state_vector.c, gate_operations.c, measurement.c) and assembly (lexer.c, parser.c, interpreter.c) modules.

3. Optimize Before Interpretation:
- In your main application, once you parse the tokens into instructions, call:
  ```bash
  optimize_circuit(&instr_list);
  ```
4. Parallel Execution:
- If you want to apply large gates in parallel, call parallel_apply_single_qubit_gate(sv, some_gate, qubit_idx, 8) (for 8 threads, for example).
- By default, the existing gate_operations.c uses single-thread code. So youâ€™d replace the call to apply_single_qubit_gate with parallel_apply_single_qubit_gate when speed is desired.

5. Memory Management:
- Replace your calls to malloc or aligned_alloc with aligned_malloc(size, 32) if you want a consistent approach across platforms.
- Modify your state_vector.c to use aligned_malloc instead of aligned_alloc if you prefer cross-platform consistency.
