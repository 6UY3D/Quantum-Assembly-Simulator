Important:

1. Adapt the inline assembly sections (asm volatile) for your target x86_64 environment (Intel, AMD, etc.).
2. Ensure your compiler supports SSE/AVX intrinsics (e.g., -mavx or -msse4.2 flags).
3. Depending on the size of your quantum system, you may need large amounts of memory.
4. This code compiles, but you should still test and validate correctness thoroughly on your target hardware.
