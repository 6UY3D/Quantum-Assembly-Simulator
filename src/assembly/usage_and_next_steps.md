1. **Integration:**
- Ensure you include assembly module sources alongside your core modules in your build system (e.g., Makefile, CMake, etc.).
- Example build command (Linux, GCC):
   ```bash
   gcc -O3 -msse4.2 -I../core -I. \
    lexer.c parser.c interpreter.c \
    ../core/qubit.c ../core/state_vector.c ../core/gate_operations.c ../core/measurement.c \
    -o quantum_assembly_sim
   ```
2. **Extended Grammar:**
- If you plan to support more advanced gates (e.g., multi-parameter gates, arbitrary rotation gates RX(θ), RY(θ), etc.), you’ll need to extend the lexer (to handle floats) and the parser (to handle function-like gate definitions).

3. **Error Handling:**
  - Currently, errors are reported with fprintf(stderr, ...). In a real production environment, you might integrate a more sophisticated logging system or return specialized error codes that propagate up to a top-level manager.
4. **Performance:**
- The parser and lexer are typically not the bottleneck. Most performance-critical sections are in the core (e.g., gate application, state updates). Continue to refine the SSE/AVX routines and possibly add multithreading for large numbers of qubits.
5. **Testing & Validation:**
- The stub #ifdef TEST_... blocks in each file illustrate how you can unit-test each component. Expand them or integrate with a test framework (e.g., Google Test, CMocka, etc.).
