# Quantum Assembly Simulator

**Welcome to the Quantum Assembly Simulator!** This project aims to provide a high-performance, assembly-focused quantum computer simulator that lets you write and execute quantum assembly code. The simulator uses a state-vector approach to represent qubits and offers built-in support for common quantum gates (Hadamard, Pauli-X/Y/Z, Phase, etc.). It also includes advanced features such as circuit optimization, parallel execution, and a custom quantum assembly language parser.

## Overview

Quantum computing relies on the principles of quantum mechanics to perform calculations that are intractable on classical computers. This simulator provides a low-level interface for exploring quantum algorithms and circuit designs. Written in a combination of C and assembly (depending on platform/architecture), it demonstrates **extreme optimizations** and offers a playground for those who want to dive into the internals of quantum simulation.

## Key Features

1. **State-Vector Simulation**: Efficiently simulate quantum circuits with up to a hardware-dependent number of qubits.
2. **Custom Quantum Assembly Language**: Write, parse, and interpret `.qasm` files with the simulator.
3. **High-Performance Optimizations**: Includes specialized assembly code for state updates, matrix multiplications, and gate operations.
4. **Parallel Execution**: Take advantage of multicore systems for faster simulations.
5. **Circuit Optimizer**: Automatically reduce redundant gates for more efficient simulation.
6. **Modular Design**: Each component (core, assembly parsing, backend) is neatly organized to facilitate extension and collaboration.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- A modern C compiler (e.g., GCC or Clang)
- Make or an equivalent build system
- Optional: An assembler for the architecture-specific optimizations (e.g., NASM, MASM, or GAS)

### Building the Simulator
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/quantum-assembly-simulator.git
   cd quantum-assembly-simulator
2. Run the build script:
   ./scripts/build.sh
   This will compile all C and assembly files into an executable (e.g., quantum_simulator).

### Running an Example
1. Go to the examples/ folder and choose a file (e.g., hello_world.qasm).
2. Execute the simulator script with the selected file:
   ./scripts/run.sh examples/hello_world.qasm
3. The simulator will parse the .qasm file, run the quantum circuit, and display the results.
