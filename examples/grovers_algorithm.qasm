// A simplified demonstration of Grover's search for a 2-qubit system,
// searching for a target "01" or "10" (you can change the oracle as needed).
//
// The example includes:
//   - Initialization of qubits into a uniform superposition.
//   - An example "oracle" gate sequence for the target.
//   - The diffusion operator, repeated once (since 2 qubits only need ~1 iteration).

// 1. Put qubits [0..1] in superposition: H on each qubit
H 0
H 1

// 2. Oracle: let's say the "marked" state is |01>. We'll flip amplitude of |01|.
//    We'll do a CNOT with qubit 0 controlling qubit 1, combined with an X gate
//    to flip the amplitude for 01. This is just a toy example. 
//
//    One approach is to convert 01 -> 11, then flip qubit 1, then revert, etc.
//    Here, we do a simpler approach with partial gates:

X 0           // If qubit 0 was |0>, it becomes |1> => 0->1 helps isolate state 01
CNOT 0 1      // If qubit 0 is 1 and qubit 1 is 1, flip qubit 1
X 0           // Revert the flip of qubit 0

// 3. Diffusion operator ~ reflection about the average:
//    For 2 qubits, a standard approach: 
//      - Apply H to each qubit
//      - Apply X to each qubit
//      - CNOT 0 1 (control=0, target=1)
//      - X each qubit
//      - H each qubit

H 0
H 1
X 0
X 1
CNOT 0 1
X 0
X 1
H 0
H 1

// 4. Measure each qubit
MEASURE 0
MEASURE 1
