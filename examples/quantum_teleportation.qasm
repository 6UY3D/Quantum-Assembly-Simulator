// Three qubits: 
//   - Qubit 0: The unknown state we want to teleport (for demonstration, we create it using X or H).
//   - Qubits 1 and 2: An entangled EPR pair to teleport the state from qubit 0 to qubit 2.
//
// Note: This example doesn't implement classical if-statements for the final correction
// (which often require a classical register). 
// We're just illustrating the main steps for educational purposes.

// 1. (Optional) Prepare an example state on qubit 0 (|psi>):
//    Let's create a superposition for demonstration:
H 0

// 2. Create an EPR pair (Bell pair) on qubits 1 and 2:
H 1
CNOT 1 2

// 3. Perform the teleportation protocol:
//    - CNOT from qubit 0 (unknown) to qubit 1
CNOT 0 1

//    - Hadamard on qubit 0
H 0

// 4. Measure qubits 0 and 1 in the computational basis
MEASURE 0
MEASURE 1

// 5. Normally, we'd conditionally apply X/Z gates on qubit 2 based on the measured bits.
//    That would "correct" the final state to match the original unknown state on qubit 2.
//    In a fully featured simulator with classical logic, you'd do something like:
//      IF measure(0) == 1 THEN X 2
//      IF measure(1) == 1 THEN Z 2
//    Instead, we stop here to show the main quantum steps.
